Welcome to the Saafcity Admin Panel repository! This admin panel is designed to manage and monitor the complaint system for garbage and sewage complaints in Saafcity. 

## Description

Saafcity is a comprehensive solution for handling complaints related to garbage and sewage. It comprises three main components:

1. **Mobile App:** Allows users to submit complaints related to garbage and sewage directly from their mobile devices. Users can provide details of the issue, attach images, and track the status of their complaints.

2. **Web Application:** Provides administrators with a dashboard to manage incoming complaints, assign tasks to relevant authorities, track the resolution progress, and generate reports for analysis.
